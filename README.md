# Spark 2

This repository contains common examples in Spark 2 with Scala. Run "mvn clean package" will create two jars e.g. spark2-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar and spark2-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar. The former only contains examples code without dependencies. The later is a fat jar. 

## software versions
Java 8, Scala 2.11 and Spark 2.2.0
